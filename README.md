# Assignment: HW3, Problem 5: Practice with HTML/CSS form

Go to this url and link your repo  https://classroom.github.com/a/A5zfadVa

Complete on the problem on freecodecamp but edit in a git hub repo using visual studio code, and live server on you home machine. Practice use of emmet. You should commit at least 15-20 times. I don't want to see a big block of code pasted in or it will be assumed that you copied it from some where. The pattern of development should be logicial. I should not see you having copied your html/css from any external source although you may certain use the same overall design. Submition both through github classroom (first) and blackboard. You may copy aftwards into codepen but I want to see the gradual development in a github repo.
